As you can see i chose minesweeper game for project, it turned out to be very difficult for me because it required to use many functions, complex algorithms, some new methods etc. 
Do complete the project i had to do a lot of research, sometimes ai because I couldn't finish it purely with my current knowledge, i especially struggled with using mmany functions at the same time, 
cuz i am not quite used to it.
Here are algorithms and data structures that i used:
1)Algorithms:
Grid Initialization,
Counting Adjacent Mines,
Revealing Cells,
Flagging Cells,
Win Condition Check,
Displaying the Grid.
2)Data Structures,
2D Array for Grid,
2D Boolean Array for Revealed Cells,
2D Boolean Array for Flagged Cells,
Random Number Generator,
Scanner for Input.
I didn't use any files for input since the project doesnt require that.
